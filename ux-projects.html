		<p>As part of the UMSI Curriculum we partnered with Atomic Object, a Custom Software Design + Development Firm with offices in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor. Atomic was interested in streamlining their Intake process for new clients.</p>

		<p>We utilized the contextual inquiry framework to identify needs and offer recommendations. Our primary research method was ethnographic interviews and we analyzed our results utilizing an affinity wall. </p>

		<p>As part of the UMSI Curriculum we partnered with ProPublica to optimize the design on their Miseducation product. Miseducation is an interactive database that lets people see the level of segregation in every school district in the country as well as the differences in opportunities and discipline for students in every school district in the country.</p>

		<p>Throughout the semester we utilized a variety of UX Research methods including: Interaction Maps, Interviews, Comparative Evaluation, Surveys, Heuristic Evaluations, Card Sorting, and Usability Tests and wrote our findings and recommendations into regular reports. We summarized all of our findings and recommendations into a final video as well as created wireframes to deliver to ProPublica.</p>

		<p>For my semester-long interaction design project, I chose to focus on solving an culture and operational problem I was seeing in the unit I worked in full-time. The problem was that while the organization was designated as a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative on campus at its inception three years prior, there were differing understandings across the organization of what it means to be a DEI initiative - and a lack of tangible mechanisms to track efforts towards creating programming that is more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.</p>

		<p>Throughout the semester, I created a competitive analysis, sketches, personas, story maps, to ideate multiple solutions. I turned the most productive ideas into a paper prototype and conducted usability tests to finalize the details for a digital prototype in Adobe XD.</p>
